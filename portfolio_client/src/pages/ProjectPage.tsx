            <p><b>I am a software engineer with a strong background in computer science, mathematics, 
              and data science, with an intense focus in DevOps, bioinformatics, AI, and web development. I develop different kinds of applications, 
              from implementing sequence alignment algorithms to building Neural Network video classification models for skateboard tricks. I have 
              built full stack web applications, working with technologies like React, TypeScript, MUI, .NET, among many other tools and libraries 
              to create interactive and efficient applications. My professional experience extends to DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and software performance
               optimization, working with the DevOps team at ResMed. I'm especially interested in AI-driven drug discovery, where I aim to apply machine learning, 
               data analysis, and high-performance computing to solve real-world biomedical challenges.<br/><br/>
