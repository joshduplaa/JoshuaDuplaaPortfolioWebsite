            <p><b>I'm a software engineer with a strong background in computer science, mathematics, 
              and data science, specializing in bioinformatics, AI, and web development. I develop different kinds of applications, 
              from implementing sequence alignment algorithms like Needleman-Wunsch and 
              Smith-Waterman to building Neural Network video classification models for skateboard tricks. I have 
              experience in full-stack web development, working with technologies like React, TypeScript, MUI, 
              and .NET to create interactive and efficient applications, including a Laboratory Information System 
              (LIS) training simulator. My expertise extends to DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and software performance
               optimization. I'm especially interested in AI-driven drug discovery, where I aim to apply machine learning, 
               data analysis, and high-performance computing to solve real-world biomedical challenges.<br/><br/>
